 <em> VoteChain - A Blockchain Voting Project </em>
</h1>
 

# Problem Statement

In today's electoral landscape, the voting system suffers from biases, lack of transparency, and security concerns that erode trust in the democratic process. Traditional voting methods are susceptible to manipulation, fraud, and inefficiencies, leading to a growing need for a more secure, transparent, and accessible voting system. To address these challenges, our project, VoteChain, seeks to revolutionize the electoral process by leveraging blockchain technology to create a tamper-proof and verifiable voting system.

# Overview

This project is an implementation of a secure and transparent voting system using blockchain technology. It aims to revolutionize the way elections are conducted, ensuring trust, integrity, and accessibility in the voting process.
